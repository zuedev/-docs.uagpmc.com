## The Modpack

Setting up the modpack is easy, but is quite unique from traditional setups. Because of this, we ask that you follow every step in this guide in order to properly download all of the mods and ensure you can jump into sessions without any issues.

We ask you to **please make sure to read all the points before you begin installation.**

### Installing

Oh shit, a video!

1. **Add Cody** on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/codyburton/) to gain access to the private mod. If you click the link make sure to **login to Steam** through the browser.

2. **Once Cody accepts your Friend Request** subscribe to our setup mod called the **Primary Session Branch** on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1092924095), this essentially keeps track of all other required mod items and allows for quick install and update.

3. Open up the ArmA III launcher and select the **Mods** tab and select **Unload All** in the top-right if you have any mods already enabled.

4. Under **Available Mods** enable the **Primary Session Branch** mod and then select the **Load Selected Mods** option to subscribe to and load our entire modpack.

5. Wait for the launcher to download and enable the mods and then you’re all done!

### Updating

Updating the modpack is simple! All you need to do is restart your **ArmA III Launcher**, **Unload All** mods, then reload the **Primary Session Branch** mod you downloaded to begin with.

## Radio Setup (ACRE2)

Installing and setting up ACRE2 is easy! When we use ACRE2 it is automatically installed in our modpack and **once you launch the game it will automatically set up in your TeamSpeak 3 client!** All you need to do is just **enable the plugin** found in **Tools->Options->Addons** of your TS3 client. In case you have TFAR installed **make sure to disable it within the TS3 Client.**

## Configuration

### Disable BattlEye

Make sure you disable Battleye when playing with us! To do this, just open the Arma 3 launcher, go to the "Battleye" option on the left side of it and untick "Enable BattlEye anti-cheat software."

### In-Game Name

You are required to change your in-game profile name to the shortened name assigned to you when you joined the unit. If you are unable to change the profile name, please create a new one with the name assigned. This simply used for identification purposes.

### Controls

#### Grenade Throwing

It is recommended to set the keybinding for grenades (when throwing them) to "double-tapping" the 'g' key.

#### Enhanced Movement

In order to use the Enhanced Movement mod (climbing over walls or strategically using people as stools) you are required to assign a key of your choice to it. In order to do this go into the 'Options' menu, 'Controls' and then find 'Custom Controls' in the dropdown menu. Find "Use Action 1" and add your preferred key. The recommended key is the backslash '\' button.

#### Quick Release Buckle

When in combat, you may find it better to quickly drop your backpack, so you need to set a key for "Release Ruck" under `Controls -> Addons -> Quick Release Buckle`. We recommend **ALT+R**.

#### Quick Release Buckle

You can knockout players and AI with your weapon! To do this, look for the "Buttstroke" control under `Controls -> Addons -> TacSalmon Buttstroke`. We recommend using **CTRL+F**.
